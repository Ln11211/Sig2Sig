# Sig2Sig
Sig2Sig is OFDM Channel estimator and equalizer based on the Pix2Pix architecture. This is a Deep learning approach for Channel estimation problem in wireless communication.

# What is Channel Estimation?

Channels fade in time and frequency.
Channel estimation refers toÂ the process of estimating the characteristics of the wireless channel between the transmitter and receiver. Equalization is the process of equalizing the channel fadign effect using the estimated channel.

## Channel fading occurs due to multihop transmission, doppler shift effect, etc

## Estimation and Equalisation are simple mathematical operations, represented as follows:

# Sig2Sig Architecture

Sig2Sig is a Deep Learning Architecture for Channel estimation and equalization.In the Deep Learning method we consider the time-frequency response of a fading communication channel as a two-dimensional image.
